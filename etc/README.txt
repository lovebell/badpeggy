INSTALLATION

Windows

Run the file "install.vbs" to create a shortcut on the desktop. It points to
the installation directory, thus will become invalid if moved or deleted.

Linux

Extract the archive to the location of your choice. Open a terminal and go
into that folder, then type "./install.sh", enter your password (sudo rights
required). Once installed the app icon should be available. You can remove
the extracted portion, because the actual installation ends up in the "/opt"
folder, from which you can then call the "./uninstall.sh" script to remove
everything.
